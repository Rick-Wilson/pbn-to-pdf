{<b>Bidding.</b> North, dealer, holds 13 points and should open the bidding. With four
diamonds and four clubs, North chooses to open 1\D.

If East passes, South has eight points and should respond. He bids 1\H; only a
four-card suit is required for responding. North must bid again after a
response in a new suit. North chooses 1NT with a balanced hand without four
hearts or four spades.

If East overcalls 1\S, South should instead double (<i>negative double</i>) to
indicate that she wanted to respond 1\H. North should rebid 1NT for the same
reasons as above.

<b>Defense.</b> East leads the \SQ, highest touching honor of a sequence. West
discourages with the \S4.

<b>Declarer play.</b> Declarer (North) considers that the objective is seven tricks.

Declarer counts four sure winners: two in spades, one in diamonds, and one in
clubs.

Declarer next considers alternatives for three additional tricks. A promotion
in hearts will yield three extra tricks. A length trick in both diamonds and
clubs is possible if the outstanding cards in those suits divide three and
three.

Declarer sees that hearts are a sure opportunity for three extra tricks, enough
to fulfill the contract.

Declarer now puts it all together: win the opening lead and promote three heart
tricks by starting with the \HJ (high card from the shorter side) so as not to
strand the heart winners. Declarer notices that once the heart tricks are
promoted, he may need an entry to dummy to take them if the defenders don't win
the \HA right away. That entry can only be the \SK, so declarer takes care to
win the opening lead with the \SA.

<b>Key point.</b> As you plan to make your contract as declarer, you usually find that
you don’t have the necessary number of sure tricks needed to make the contract.
One way to develop extra tricks is through promotion. Promotion is as simple as
playing your high cards in order to drive out the opponents’ high cards. You
sacrifice tricks in order to gain tricks.

Tricks are only good, however, if you can get to them. You need to be careful
to keep high cards in the same hand as your eventual winning tricks, so that
you can get to the winning cards.}

[Scoring ""]

[Contract "4S"]
[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding.</b> West, dealer, has 13 points and should open the bidding. West chooses
1\C since 1\S would show five spades and 1\D would show four diamonds (unless
exactly 4=4=3=2).

East holds 14 points and knows that his side belongs in game. East begins a
search for a fit in spades by responding 1\S, which shows four or more spades
and requires opener to bid again.

With four spades, West knows that a fit exists and plans to raise spades. West
reevaluates his hand as a dummy, but with no shortness the hand remains at 13
points. This is in the minimum range (13–16 points), so West just raises spades
one level by bidding 2\S. East concludes the auction by jumping to game in
spades.

<b>Defense.</b> South leads the \HK. Only a two-card honor sequence is required for
leading against suit contracts. North holds an equivalent honor and so
encourages South to continue playing hearts by playing the \H9, the highest
spot card. The defense continues with two more rounds of hearts.

<b>Declarer play.</b> Declarer (East) considers that the objective is ten tricks.
Declarer counts eight sure winners: five in spades and three in clubs.

Declarer next considers alternatives for extra tricks. A promotion in diamonds
will yield two extra tricks, enough to fulfill the contract. Ruffing the third
round of hearts will not increase the trick total since those spades are
already counted for winners, but ruffing does keep the opponents from taking
more than two heart tricks.

Since declarer is in a trump contract, declarer should also count the fast
losers: two in hearts and one in diamonds. Declarer can afford to lose three
tricks, so there is no problem with losers.

Declarer now puts it all together: assuming the opponents play three rounds of
high hearts, declarer ruffs the third round, pulls trumps (trumps are not
otherwise needed for ruffing), and forces out the \DA. The only snag will occur
if one opponent has all four spades, in which case declarer must promote the
diamonds before pulling all the trumps.

<b>Key point.</b> Whenever you play a hand in a suit contract, you have to decide when
to draw the trumps. It’s usually a good idea to draw them right away,
especially if you have the number of losers you can afford. You don’t want to
create an extra loser for yourself by having the opponents use one of their
trumps on a trick you hadn’t intended to lose.}

[Contract "3NT"]
[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding.</b> Dealer (South) has 15 points and should open. Some will open 1NT
(15–17 balanced) and some will discount the fifth diamond in a weak suit and
open 1\D.

After a 1NT opening, North should drive the hand to game, but should check for
a fit in hearts on the way by bidding 2\C Stayman. South will deny a four-card
major by rebidding 2\D, and North can then go directly to 3NT.

After a 1\D opening, North, with 11 points, should respond. He chooses 1\H as
only a four-card suit is required for responding. With a minimum-range,
balanced hand without four hearts or four spades, South rebids 1NT.

North knows that South may have 14 points, enough for game, so invites with his
balanced hand by rebidding 2NT (11–12 points). South, with a maximum for his
previous bidding, bids the game in notrump.

<b>Defense.</b> West has no sequence to lead, so chooses to start with clubs in an
effort to promote tricks there. West chooses the \C5, the fourth-best club, by
convention ("fourth-best from your longest and strongest").

<b>Declarer play.</b> Declarer (South) considers that the objective is nine tricks.

Declarer counts seven sure winners: one in spades, two in hearts, two in
diamonds, and two in clubs.

Declarer next considers alternatives for two extra tricks. Two length tricks in
diamonds are possible if the outstanding cards divide three and two. No other
extra tricks are likely elsewhere, but two extra tricks are enough for the
contract.

Declarer now puts it all together: win the opening lead and promote two extra
diamond tricks by first giving up a diamond (best to give up tricks you must
lose first). Declarer regains the lead in any suit and takes one spade, two
hearts, four diamonds (leading the \DK next), and two clubs to fulfill the
contract.

<b>Key point.</b> When declarer knows that more tricks need to be developed, one of
the best sources of tricks can be found in long suits. If declarer plus dummy
hold at least seven cards in a suit, or if either declarer or dummy hold at
least five cards in a suit, the could provide a source of extra tricks. Of
course a suit of more than seven cards combined offers an even more likely
source of extra tricks.}

[Scoring ""]

[Contract "4S"]
[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding.</b> Dealer (East) and South do not have enough points to open, but West,
with 17 points, should do. With an unbalanced hand, West chooses 1\S, showing
at least five spades.

North needs both a good five-card suit and opening values to overcall at the
two-level, and so passes.

East knows that his side has a fit in spades, so reevaluates his hand as a
dummy. With no shortness, East has nine points, a minimum-range response (6–10
points), and so raises spades one level to 2\S.

West, with an intermediate-range opening hand, now knows that his side may have
enough points for game, and so bids 3\S. East has nearly a maximum for a simple
raise, and so proceeds to the spade game.

<b>Defense.</b> North should lead the \HA, highest of an honor sequence. A two-card
sequence is adequate when defending a suit contract. South holds an equivalent
honor to North's presumed \HK, so encourages a heart continuation by playing
the \H9. North should continue with the \HK since South might hold a doubleton
heart, looking to ruff.

<b>Declarer play.</b> Declarer (West) considers that the objective is ten tricks.

Declarer counts eight immediate winners: four in spades, two in diamonds, and
two in clubs.

Declarer next considers alternatives for two extra tricks: a length trick is
likely in spades if the outstanding cards divide three and two (3-2) or four
and one (4-1).  A promotion of one trick in diamonds is possible if the
outstanding diamonds divide 3-2, as is likely. No other extra tricks are likely
elsewhere, but two extra tricks are enough to fulfill the contract.

Since this is a trump contract, declarer counts the immediate losers: just one
in hearts, so no problem with losers.

Declarer now puts it all together: assuming that the opponents persist with
high hearts, ruff the second heart, pull the opponent's trumps, and promote
another winner in diamonds.

<b>Key point.</b> Long suits come in handy, not only in notrump but in suit contracts.
Once the trumps are drawn, in fact, a suit contract is very much like playing
in notrump. Often all that is required is a normal division of the missing
cards and declarer’s ability to take advantage of it.}
