{<b>Exercise One — Strength Versus Length</b>

Compare what would happen if you (West) led each of the suits in Exercise One
against a notrump contract and against a suit contract (assuming another suit
is trumps). Look at the number of winners you are likely to get if you lead the
suit and the number of tricks you sacrifice by leading the suit. Would you
normally lead the suit against a notrump contract, a suit contract. or both?}

{When you lead the suit (fourth highest), declarer takes two tricks with the
queen and ace, rather than one. Against a notrump contract, you are willing to
sacrifice one trick since you end up developing three tricks. Against a suit
contract, however, you will have sacrificed that trick in vain. Declarer would
end up with no losers in the suit, rather than the one declarer started with.
Declarer can ruff any further leads of the suit in hand. In conclusion, you
would want to lead this suit against a notrump contract, but not against a suit
contract.}

{You can take two tricks by leading the suit against a notrump contract, but
declarer also gets two tricks. By leading this suit, you actually are helping
declarer develop an extra winner. It usually will be best to avoid leading this
suit. Keep your high cards as later entries to your long suit and make declarer
do the work of developing an extra trick in the suit. Against a trump contract,
declarer already has two losers in this suit (since it divides 3–3). By leading
the suit, you are not helping declarer, since you are getting only the tricks
to which you are entitled. This is a good suit to lead against a suit contract.
If you wait too long, declarer may be able to discard some of the losers in
hand.}

in doing so, you develop four tricks. You may not be able to wait for partner
to get in and lead the suit, so this is a good choice of suits to lead against
a notrump contract. Against a suit contract, you give declarer an extra trick.
Declarer started with two losers but ends up with only one if you lead the
suit. It is better to wait until declarer or partner leads the suit. Then you
take the two tricks to which you are entitled.}

declarer starts with one loser, a suit in which you hold a sequence and four or
more cards is good to lead against a suit contract as well as a notrump
contract. You want to develop your winner before declarer can discard the
loser.}

too many tricks before declarer can ruff. Partner is marked with some strength
because you are weak, so there is a good chance of partner winning a couple of
tricks and giving you one or more ruffs.}

you automatically lead a singleton just because you have one, consider two
things: (1) whether you can reasonably expect your partner to be able to lead
the suit before declarer pulls your trumps, and (2) whether you will gain
anything if partner can lead the suit. You are probably better off to look
elsewhere for your tricks, if you have natural trump tricks or a lot of trumps.}

one trick, leading a low card costs nothing and avoids stranding your winners.

undeserved trick. Declarer may even be able to discard some losers and you may
not get either your ace or your king. By leading the ace, the king and then

{<b>Exercise Eight Answer</b>

1) The first step is to consider your objective.

<i>Your objective is to take 10 tricks with hearts as trump.</i>

2) The second step is to count the number of immediate winners you have, the
number of tricks that you can take without giving up the lead.

<i>There are five immediate winners — one spade,</i> <i>no hearts, three diamonds, one
club.</i>

3) The third step is to identify possible ways to get extra winners.

<i>Ruff two spades in dummy. Promote three tricks in hearts. Length trick in
clubs.</i>

4) The last step is to choose you order of play.

<i>You cannot afford to lead trumps</i> <i>right away for two reasons: (1) you need to
ruff two spades in dummy, so cannot</i> <i>afford to play three rounds of hearts,
which the defenders might do if you lead</i> <i>them; (2) with the club lead, the
defenders threaten to take two club tricks</i> <i>plus their two heart tricks, too
many. You must discard a club loser on the</i> <i>extra diamond winner in dummy, and
ruff spades before leading trumps. The</i> <i>\CA and \DQ will be the two entries to
your hand needed to ruff spades.</i>

<i>Win the \CA. Play the \SA and ruff a spade. Play a diamond to the \DQ, and ruff</i>
<i>your last spade. Play the \DA-K, discarding a club loser. That's seven tricks</i>
<i>in, and nothing can stop you from promoting three more tricks in hearts.</i>}
