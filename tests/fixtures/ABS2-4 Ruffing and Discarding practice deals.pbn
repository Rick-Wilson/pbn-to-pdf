{<b>Discarding a Loser</b>

<b>Bidding.</b> North opens 1\S. With 16 dummy points and support for all of the unbid
suits, East makes a takeout double.

Regardless of the takeout double, South holds nine points with spade support,
so raises to 2\S. South is too strong to recommend a weak 3\S response over the
takeout double.

North tries for game by rebidding 3\S, which South accepts holding a good hand
for her previous raise.

<b>Defense.</b> East leads the \CK, highest of touching honors. West discourages with
the \C3.

<b>Declarer play.</b> Declarer counts six sure winners and needs four more. Spades can
be promoted for four more winners.

Since this is a trump contract, declarer takes the additional step of checking
for fast losers. The lead will have to be surrendered twice to establish enough
winners, and the club lead has promoted two more fast losers in clubs. That's
too many losers.

Declarer looks for opportunities to discard a loser, and finds it in diamonds
where there is an extra winner in dummy. Declarer wins the \CA and immediately
plays \DQ-K-A, discarding a club loser. Now declarer can tackle spades. The
defense takes two spade tricks, but only one club trick.

<b>Key point.</b> Often when there is weakness in one suit, there is compensating
strength in another. In this deal, the extra strength in diamonds provided an
opportunity to eliminate a club loser. In putting it all together, declarer
couldn’t draw trumps first, since the opponents would get the lead and take
their club winners before declarer had discarded a loser.}

{<b>Discarding a Loser</b>

<b>Bidding.</b> East passes and South opens 1\H. West holds 15 dummy points and
support for all of the unbid suits, so doubles for takeout.

North holds four-card support for hearts, but with such a weak hand otherwise,
not to mention the vulnerability, declines to raise to 3\H, which would be weak
over the takeout double.

East holds 11 points, so advances by jumping to 2\S. West judges that game is
possible, so raises to 3\S. East holds a maximum for her previous bidding, so
bids game.

<b>Defense.</b> South has three defensive tricks, and leads the fourth-best \H5 trying
to develop a fourth trick in hearts. North plays \HQ, third hand high, so that
declarer doesn't win an undeserved trick with the \HJ.

<b>Declarer play.</b> Four sure tricks, needing six more. Three more tricks can be
promoted in spades, and three more in diamonds. That's 10 tricks, but check the
loser situation.

Declarer has three sure losers, and the heart lead has established another.
That's too many. Declarer has an extra winner in clubs, so before playing
spades (or diamonds), declarer plays \n
\CK-Q-A, discarding the heart loser.

Now declarer tackles trumps. After trumps are drawn in two rounds, declarer
tackles diamonds. The defense takes only two spades and a diamond trick.

<b>Key point.</b> Declarer has to eliminate the heart loser before letting the
opponents have the lead. On this deal, that means trumps can’t be played
(because the opponents would get the lead) until declarer gets rid of the \HJ
on the extra club winner.}

{<b>Ruffing a Loser</b>

<b>Bidding.</b> If West adds a point for her five-card diamond suit and opens 1NT, the
auction might get very interesting. North holds enough to make a standard
penalty double, which South will pass, hoping to defeat 1NT. If West stays the
course and also passes, she will find that 1NT is unbeatable, despite
North-South holding the balance of strength.

If West opens 1\D, North-South should get to hearts. North holds 18 dummy
points and support for all of the unbid suits, so doubles for takeout. East
passes, and South advances with 1\H.

North holds 19 dummy points and knows that game is still possible, even though
South holds less than eight points. North raises to 2\H, but South holds a
minimum and passes.

<b>Defense.</b> West leads the \DA, highest of touching honors. East encourages with
the \D9, which might be a doubleton. West continues with the \DK and a low
diamond.

<b>Declarer play.</b> Glad to be no higher than 2\H, declarer counts six sure winners
and needs two more. A diamond ruff in dummy will provide another, as will heart
length. Another trick might come from spade length.

A count of losers reveals two in hearts and two in diamonds, so no worries
about fast losers.

After ruffing a diamond, declarer should pull trumps. It is good technique to
duck a round of hearts, but playing the \HA does no harm on this deal.

<b>Key point.</b> Declarer can gain winners by ruffing losers in the dummy. Declarer
often has to manage the trump suit carefully in order to both ruff losers and
draw the missing trumps.}

{<b>Ruffing a Loser</b>

<b>Bidding.</b> West passes and North opens 1\C, preferring to open 1\C when 3–3 in
the minors.

Holding 14 dummy points and support for all of the unbid suits, East doubles
for takeout.

South holds enough to compete to 2\C. Over 2\C, West need not bid. But, with
eight points, West judges that 2\H will have a chance.

<b>Defense.</b> Considering South's raise, North leads the \C3, low from an honor.
South plays the \CJ, third hand only just as high as necessary.

<b>Declarer play.</b> Declarer counts four sure winners and needs four more. Two can
be promoted in diamonds, and another will come from heart length if the
defender's hearts divide 3-2, as is likely. A club ruff will suffice for an
eighth trick.

To conserve entries, declarer ducks the opening club lead. Then declarer can
win the club continuation in hand to ruff a club in dummy.

Ducking a heart might expose declarer to a ruff, so declarer next cashes the
\HA-K. Leaving a high trump outstanding, declarer now tackles diamonds.
Declarer scores one spade, two high hearts and a heart trick by length in hand,
two diamonds, one club, and a club ruff. The defense is held to two spades, one
heart, one diamond, and one club.

<b>Key point.</b> Declarer can eliminate a loser in hand by ruffing it in the dummy.}
