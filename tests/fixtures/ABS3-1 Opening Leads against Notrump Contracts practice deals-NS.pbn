{<b>Regarding Partner</b>

<b>Bidding.</b> West opens 1\D. North's 1NT overcall shows much the same as a 1NT
opening bid, but also with some strength in opener's suit.

East passes. South holds 10 points, giving her side at least 25 points, making
3NT a good proposition.

<b>Defense.</b> It is unlikely that East can set up and run hearts given that there
are no outside entries. East chooses to lead partner's suit, and starts with
the \D9, highest of a doubleton.

<i>Fine point. </i>West can afford to overtake the \D9 opening lead in case East
started with a singleton.

<b>Declarer play.</b> You (North) count six sure tricks and need three more. A finesse
of the \HJ might get you one more, but that's not enough. You will need to
promote three tricks in clubs.

You should hold up in diamonds in case diamonds are 5-2 or 6-1 and East holds
the \CA or \CK.

Unfortunately for you, if East leads diamonds and the defenders continue
diamonds at every opportunity, the defense will take three diamond and two club
tricks. Had diamonds not been led, or if diamonds had divided 4-3, or if East
held the \CA or \CK, then you would have made 3NT.

<b>Key point.</b> The diamonds offer the best chance of defeating the contract, but
the defenders have to be persistent. The first step is for East to lead
diamonds, the suit East's partner bid. Then, West has to continue leading
diamonds at every opportunity in order to defeat declarer’s contract. Notrump
contracts are often a race to see which side can develop sufficient winners
first.}

{<b>In Good Order</b>

<b>Bidding.</b> East passes. South holds a balanced hand of 15 points, and opens 1NT,
though some might find a 1\D opening bid more to their taste.

West passes. North holds the values for game (but not slam), but would prefer
to play in spades if South also holds four. North uses the Stayman 2\C
convention to see if South holds four spades.

East passes. South bids 2\D to deny holding a four-card major.

West passes. North proceeds to the game in notrump since there is no fit in
spades.

<i>Alternate bidding. </i>If South judges the hand as not strong enough to open 1NT,
the auction would be:

     1\D-1\S; 1NT-3NT; All pass

<b>Defense.</b> Hearts is West's best suit. On the \HJ opening lead (highest of
interior sequence), East realizes that South holds the \HQ. She plays the \HA
in case partner holds the \HK, which avoids presenting declarer with an
undeserved trick with the \HQ. East returns the \H2 as a count signal so that
West will know that East started with an even number of hearts (and now has an
odd number remaining). The recommended auction also revealed that South does
not hold four hearts.

<b>Declarer play. </b>The defenders must immediately take their four heart tricks and
the \CA to defeat 3NT. Otherwise declarer takes nine tricks — four spades and
five diamonds.

<b>Key point.</b> Leading the highest card from a strong sequence often provides the
defenders with a good chance to defeat the contract. If partner leads a high
card, you have to use your imagination to visualize partner’s holding in the
suit. In this deal, East knew from West’s opening lead that declarer held the
\HQ. If partner held the \HK, then declarer’s \HQ could be trapped — if East
won the first trick with the \HA.}

[Contract "3NT"]
[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding.</b> West passes. North holds a balanced hand of 22 points. North
starts with an opening bid of 2\C to show at least 22 points of any
distribution.

East passes. South must respond to a 2\C opening bid. With less than eight
points, South responds 2\D, an artificial “waiting” bid.

West passes. North rebids 2NT to show a balanced hand of 22–24 points.

East passes. South knows there are enough points for game, but not slam. With
no interest in a major-suit contract, South bids 3NT to end the auction.

<b>Defense.</b> Without a sequence, East leads \H6 (fourth-best). West cannot
contribute to winning the trick, so plays the \H7 as a count signal.

<b>Declarer play.</b> You count seven sure winners, plus a heart trick from the
opening lead. You will need to get a trick from clubs.

<i>Fine point. </i>Declarer's best line is to win the opening lead with the
\H10 and immediately lead the \C2 (or tricky \CJ) <u>from dummy</u> since there
will have nine tricks if West ducks (East will never duck the \CA if looking
at the setting tricks in hearts). West must realize that East can have at
most seven points, and that the \HK Q and \CQ will not be enough to defeat the
contract. Only the \HA K x x x will suffice to defeat the contract, so West
should play for that holding by winning the \CA and returning a heart.

Of course, this is a difficult defense to envision. Another winning view is
that West must win the \CA immediately and lead hearts in order to preserve
any later entry East may have.

If declarer plays winners immediately, West will need to keep her second heart
so that she can play it after winning the \CA.

<b>Key point.</b> The only way for the defenders to defeat the contract is for
East to lead a low heart. Declarer takes the first trick, but when West gets
the lead with the \CA, West leads a heart. East has enough winners to defeat
the contract. Notice that West should return partner’s suit even when declarer
or dummy wins the first trick. Also notice that West must rise with the \CA at
the first opportunity — otherwise, declarer has nine winners (four diamonds,
three spades, one heart and one club) for game.}

{<b>A Little Help</b>

<b>Bidding.</b> East passes. South holds a balanced hand of 15 points, and
opens 1NT, though some might find a 1\D opening bid more to their taste.

West passes. North holds enough points for game, but not slam. North would
prefer to play in a major-suit fit, if one exists, so bids the Stayman 2\C
convention.

East passes. South bids 2\D to deny holding a four-card major suit.

West passes. North places the contract in 3NT, assured that there is no fit in
a major suit.

<b>Defense.</b> West leads the \C2 as less is needed from partner in clubs to
develop tricks than in hearts or diamonds. Besides, the \HA and \DA will be
entries to established clubs, but not the reverse.

<i>Fine point. </i>East should play \C9 if declarer ducks the opening lead in
dummy, but it doesn't matter here. We will look more closely at surrounding
dummy's honors in the class about <i>third-hand play<b>.</b></i>

If declarer holds up the \CA, East continues with a low club as a count signal
to show that she remains with an odd number of clubs.

<b>Declarer play.</b> You count five sure tricks and need four more. You should
play on diamonds, rather than hearts, as diamonds alone will provide enough
extra tricks for the contract.

West can take her club tricks and the \HA once she wins the \DA. If East is
going to win the fourth club, then West should cash the \HA before giving up
the lead.

<b>Key point.</b> West has a choice of three suits that would be reasonable to
lead. If North opens 1\D rather than 1NT, West can eavesdrop on the opponent's
bidding, making the better unbid suit the logical choice for an opening lead.
If North opens 1NT, West will have less information to guide her opening lead,
and must reason well to find the club lead. If West leads any other suit,
declarer will have no trouble making the contract.}
