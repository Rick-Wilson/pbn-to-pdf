[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>South uses a negative double to show that he would have responded
1\H. He should hold five hearts and at least 11 points to respond 2\H. South is
prepared to bid 2NT if North rebids 2\D.

North bids 2\H (13–16 support points), just as he would have done had South
responded 1\H.

South holds game-invitational strength, so bids once more. North holds a
maximum for the previous bidding and continues to game.

<b>Defense. </b>East holds unattractive holdings for leading spades, hearts, or clubs.
West cannot be expected to hold many values. The \DQ seems best. West can
encourage with the \D8 since she holds the \D10, an equivalent honor to East's
presumed \DJ.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer counts six sure winners. Declarer hopes for a winning
spade finesse (very likely to work), a length trick from hearts, and two or
three additional tricks from clubs.

Declarer should duck one round of hearts to maintain control should they divide
4-1. She can then play \HK-A (unless East proves to hold four hearts) before
taking the club finesse.

Declarer should end up with at least 10 tricks for plus 420.

<b>Key point.</b> Bidding your own suit at the two-level or higher after an overcall
promises five cards. Double of a 1\S overcall shows four (or more) hearts and
eight or more points.  After making a negative double, responder may be
prepared to bid 2NT or 3NT if a major-suit fit isn't revealed.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>North uses a negative double to show both minors. North isn't strong
enough to bid 2\C, though the good club suit is worth more than it looks.
Unless South shows some extra values then game is out of reach.

East should not raise spades. His spades are poor, he holds minimum values,
and he has no shortness to gain tricks by ruffing.

South does best to rebid 1NT with his decent spade holding. He should on no
account pass the double for penalties unless holding four spades (1\S goes set
only with perfect defense).

<b>Defense. </b>West should start with his fourth-best \S7. When leading your own
suit, lead an honor against a notrump contract only from a sequence. East
cannot contribute the \S9 or higher, so should give count with the \S2.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer counts five sure winners. Clubs provide the best chance
for more.

Wanting to start clubs from her hand, declarer ducks the spade lead to his
jack. This is also the best play if East should hold a high honor in spades.
North then leads the \C9 (high card from the shorter side) for a double finesse,
playing low from dummy unless West plays the queen.

East will win the \CK and continue spades by playing the eight, highest of a
remaining doubleton. Declarer can hold up her ace, but West will persist with
spades.

Declarer now leads the \C5 for a second finesse of clubs. This wins, and the
\CA draws the queen. Declarer now has no fewer than nine tricks for plus 150.
Perhaps North should have bid more strongly!

<b>Key point.</b> Double of a 1\S overcall shows four (or more) hearts and eight or
more points. Opener rebids as if partner had responded 1\H.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>South uses a negative double to show that he would have responded
1\H. South also holds the other unbid suit, clubs.

West should raise the spade overcall to 2\S or 3\S (weak). If West bids only
2\S, North holds 16 points in support of hearts, and stretches a point to rebid
3 \H. South holds enough to make game a good proposition.

If West bids 3\S, North should pass and South might double again to show extra
values.. North should then bid game in hearts. Note how West's preemptive
action can make it more difficult for South-North to reach game. 3\S goes set
one trick, so perhaps should be bid only if not vulnerable.

<b>Defense. </b>East should lead the \SK, highest of touching honors against a suit
contract, and should continue spades from the solid sequence.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer counts five sure tricks. Declarer hopes for one more
from heart length, and can get three or four more from diamonds. If necessary,
the club finesse will have to be risked.

Declarer ruffs the second spade. Declarer wants to start diamonds from dummy,
so leads a low heart to the king. He then makes the key play of the \D 9,
playing low from his hand. When this draws the \D A, the rest should be easy.

Playing diamonds this way is indicated because East surely holds the \D A for
the overcall since she does not hold the \S A, and may well be short in
diamonds. Taking advantage of the \D 9 picks up the \D J x x x from West.

Declarer can finish with 11 tricks for plus 450.

<b>Key point.</b> In a competitive auction, jump raises of opening bids and overcalls
are weak based on a nine-card fit and less than constructive values (4-7
support points).}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>West's 1\H overcall does not keep North from responding 1\S. Most
would instead use a negative double to show exactly four spades, reserving a
1\S response to show five or more.

South raises spades,¹ just as she would have done had North responded 1\S. North
holds enough to bid game.

¹ Some would bid 2\S, as if responder bid 1\S, to show four spades and obstruct
overcaller's rebid.

<b>Defense. </b>West should lead the \HK, highest of touching honors against a suit
contract. East does not hold an equivalent honor (ace or jack) and so
discourages with the \H2.

West should note East's discouraging \H2 and switch to a passive club, the
\C8 (top of nothing) to deny strength in the suit.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer counts seven sure winners and needs three more. One
additional trick might come from a successful spade finesse, and another from
spade length. A successful diamond finesse and a 3-3 division of clubs are two
additional chances, and perhaps a heart or club can be ruffed in dummy.

South should begin by ducking the opening lead of the \HK. Declarer has no
immediate discard for a heart loser, and the duck keeps West from continuing
hearts lest declarer score an undeserved trick with the \HJ.

Declarer can take the spade finesse either way. He would prefer to keep East
from leading a heart through his jack, so plays \SA and a low spade to the 10.
If West could win this trick, she still could not lead a second heart
productively.

When the spade finesse wins, declarer can play the \SK to draw the remaining
trump. Declarer now has ten tricks (with inevitable ruff in dummy), and can try
the diamond finesse for an overtrick. When the diamond finesse wins and the
clubs divide 3-3, declarer finishes with no fewer then 12 tricks for plus 680.
Some days everything works!

<b>Key point.</b> Double of a 1\H overcall shows exactly four spades. Bidding 1\S
shows five or more, which simplifies subsequent bidding decisions.}

{<b>Bidding. </b>South uses a negative double to show that she would have responded
1\S. South also holds the other unbid suit, clubs.

North jumps in spades to show extra values (17–18 support points).

South reevaluates to 12 points, well enough to bid game.

<b>Defense. </b>East starts with the \DA, West encouraging with the seven since she
desires a ruff. East continues with high diamonds, and West should discard a
low heart on the third diamond. This preserves the club length to match that of
dummy, and at the same time prepares West to ruff hearts.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer counts eight sure tricks. Declarer plans to develop
more by ruffing hearts and by heart length.

Declarer cannot draw trumps as they are required for ruffing hearts and for
entries to hand. Declarer starts with the \HA-K and a third heart to ruff in
dummy.

Somewhat disappointingly, West ruffs the third heart. Don't panic, you're not
set yet! West must return a club (or a trump). Declarer can now play a spade to
her hand and ruff another heart with the \SQ so that West cannot overruff. Now
the last spade from dummy allows declarer to pull trumps and enjoy her long
heart for plus 620.

<b>Key point.</b> Don't look down on shortness in opener's first suit when you're
dummy for opener's second suit. Ruffs are tricks, and can be used to establish
length winners.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>North uses a negative double to show that she would have responded
1\H. She also holds the other unbid suit, diamonds.

South holds 20 points, too much to just jump to 3\C. 4\C is a possibility, but
that goes past 3NT. Best is to cue-bid 2\S, a general forcing bid, to leave
open the opportunity to play 3NT.

North has no spade guard for notrump, and can do no better than to show four
diamonds (in addition to the four hearts she already showed). South now shows
his hand by bidding 4\C. With nothing wasted for South-North in spades, North bids
game in clubs.

<b>Defense. </b>West should start with the \SA (highest of touching honors against a
suit contract), on which East should discourage with the two. Regardless,
West should continue with high spades. Knowing that East can have very little
given the bidding and her hand, West leaves it to declarer to find enough
tricks.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer counts 10 sure tricks and needs one more. A successful
finesse of diamonds or hearts will land the contract, but a losing finesse will
sink the contract immediately.

Since declarer can try only one finesse, declarer first plays the A-K in one of
the suits to try to catch the queen.

<i>Chance 1. </i>Declarer should pull trump, then play \DA-K to see if the queen
drops. It does, declarer has eleven tricks for plus 600. South fulfills the
contract even though neither finesse is working!

<i>Chance 2. </i>Had the \DQ not fallen, only then would declarer have to risk the
heart finesse by playing \HK and a heart to the \HJ.

Why play off the high diamonds rather than the high hearts? A finesse is a
50-50 proposition, but not so catching a doubleton queen. Holding more combined
diamonds than hearts, it is more likely that a defender holds \DQ x than \HQ x.

<b>Key point.</b> Hands with a long minor suit and 19–21 points are awkward to bid.
After opening your suit, you may have to guess whether to jump to 3NT or make a
“prepared” reverse or jump-shift in a three-card suit.  •  As declarer, look
for ways to combine your various chances.}
