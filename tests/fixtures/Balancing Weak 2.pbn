{Most bad results come from bidding unsafely.  Sometimes you just have to let
the opponents have their day.  When deciding whether to act, you must be
prepared for all of partner's responses.  However, when balancing a preemptive
bid you should assume that partner has at least a somewhat useful seven-count
(Seven-Point Rule).
