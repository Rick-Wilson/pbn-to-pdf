{<b>Bidding.</b> After North opens 1NT and East passes, South knows the partnership
belongs in a partscore in hearts. Using a <i>Jacoby Transfer</i> bid, South responds
2\D, asking that opener bid 2\H. South now passes to leave the partnership in
its best contract.

<b>Defense.</b> East is on lead and selects the \D10, highest of touching honors. West
should play the \DQ in case East has lead from \DK 10 9.

<b>Declarer play.</b> With the lead of a diamond, North has three sure tricks in
diamonds, but no other sure tricks.

Four tricks in hearts can be promoted, but the lead will have to be lost twice.
Another two tricks can be promoted in clubs. That's plenty of winners. <i>Is there
any problem?</i>

To promote sufficient tricks, the lead must be lost three times. North must
consider the number of tricks that could be lost. Two heart and one club trick
must be lost, and possibly three tricks in spades. That's too many. <i>What
precaution should declarer take?</i>

With the lead of a diamond, North has three winners in diamonds and two <i>extra
winners</i> — winners on which losers can be discarded. North cannot discard enough
losers in clubs to matter, but can discard two losers in spades. Then, the most
North can lose in spades is one trick before being able to ruff.

Discarding immediate losers must be done first. Declarer should play three high
clubs, discarding spades from dummy. Only then can trumps be drawn. Lastly,
North plays on clubs.

<b>Key point.</b> Notice that the 2\H contract might be less successful if played from
South’s side of the table. West might lead the \SQ, trapping North’s \SK. The
defenders could take three spade tricks, two heart tricks and the \DA to defeat
the contract. The transfer bid makes quite a difference to the outcome.

East–West will have difficulty defeating a 2\H contract played from the North
hand. The only winning defense is for East to lead a heart! This hand
illustrates one of the advantages of Jacoby transfer bids. The opening leader
has to choose a lead that plays into the strong hand. This frequently costs the
defense one or more tricks.

South does well to remove partner from the 1NT contract. After a diamond lead
against 1NT, careful defense will restrict North to three diamond tricks and
two club tricks.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding.</b> After South opens 1NT, North uses a Jacoby Transfer bid to request
that partner bid spades. After South accepts the transfer, North raises to 4\S
holding 11 points and knowing that there is at least an 8-card spade fit.

If not playing Jacoby Transfers, North should just respond 4\S.

<b>Defense.</b> South is now declarer and West has the opening lead. The \CQ stands
out. East encourages with the \C8.

<b>Declarer play.</b> South counts six immediate tricks in spades plus one in diamonds
and clubs. There may be a trick in hearts, but the diamond suit looks more
fruitful. Even if the diamond finesse loses, there are at least two more tricks
to be had. <i>Is there any problem?</i>

Check the number of immediate losers. With the club lead, South might lose one
club, one diamond, and two heart tricks if neither the heart or diamond
finesses are working. <i>What what precaution should declarer take?</i>

The trick is to keep East from gaining the lead. Only East can lead through
South's vulnerable \HK. Even if the diamond finesse loses, West cannot lead
hearts to good effect.

South should let West win the \CQ! Then the second round of clubs can be won
with the \CA and a third round ruffed in dummy (if necessary) without East ever
gaining the lead. After pulling trumps, ending in the North hand, declarer runs
the \DJ, losing to the \DK. But, declarer can use dummy's good diamonds to
discard heart losers. In fact, if West does not cash the \HA, she won't get it!

<b>Key point.</b> Although East–West cannot legitimately defeat a contract of 4\H
played by South if declarer is careful, they may get an opportunity. When West
leads the \CQ, East should play the \C8 as an encouraging signal. If declarer
wins the first trick with the \CA, draws trumps, and then takes the diamond
finesse, West can win the \DK and lead a club to East’s \CK. East can finish
off a fine defense by leading the \HQ to trap declarer’s \HK.

If North–South aren’t using transfer bids, East–West will have an excellent
chance to defeat the contract. East would be on lead and could lead the \HQ,
giving the defenders the first two tricks. If they now switch to clubs, they
can take a club trick after declarer loses the finesse to West’s \DK.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding.</b> With an invitational-strength hand and a five-card major suit, South
transfers North to 2\H and then bids 2NT. With a maximum-strength hand for the
1NT opening bid, North has enough to accept the invitation. With the knowledge
that South has five hearts, North puts the partnership in game in the eight-card
fit.

If not playing Jacoby Transfers, South should respond Stayman 2\C, then bid 3\H
(forcing) when North replies 2\S.

<b>Defense.</b> East is on lead and probably will start with the \DJ, highest of
touching honors.

<b>Declarer play.</b> North counts two immediate spade winners, another in diamonds,
and two more in clubs. That leaves North needing to find five more tricks.

Four tricks probably can be promoted in hearts. A finesse of the \CJ is a
possibility for another trick, as is a 3–3 division of spades. Checking
immediate losers. there are only two, the \HA and a diamond, so no worries
there.

Let's say North wins the \DA and tackles trumps, ruffing the third round of
diamonds if necessary. <i>What should declarer play after drawing trumps?</i>

North should next test the spades. A spade must be lost in any event, but then
North's fourth spade is the game-going winner. If spades had not divided 3–3,
only then would North have needed to try the club finesse.

<b>Key point.</b> If declarer tries the club finesse before testing spades, the
contract can be defeated. When the club finesse loses, declarer can end up
losing a trick in every suit. With a choice of plays for extra winners, plays
when both can be attempted, first try the one in which a trick <i>must </i>be lost
(spades), saving for second the one in which a trick <i>might </i>be lost (clubs).

If South–North reach 3NT, rather than 4\H, the defenders have an opportunity to
defeat the contract. East will start with the \DJ, and West must be careful
to play a high diamond on this trick to avoid blocking the suit. If West plays
the two high diamonds early, East–West can get four diamond tricks to go
along with the \HA.}

[Contract "3D"]
[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding.</b> After North’s opening 1NT bid, South has a hand for which the best
contract is likely to be a partscore in diamonds. Since a 2\D response would be
a transfer to hearts, South starts by responding 2\S. This asks North to bid 3\C.
South now bids 3\D, a sign-off bid, and North passes.

<b>Defense.</b> West is on lead and probably will lead the \HK. Short but strong
suits are attractive leads against suit contracts (but not against notrump
contracts). East discourages with the \H3 (West might hold only the \HK Q, so
East has no equivalent honor).

<b>Declarer play.</b> South counts just three immediate winners, so needs six more.
Promotion in diamonds will garner four more. Spades will provide two more. A
check of immediate losers reveals only five, two in hearts, two in diamonds,
and probably one in spades. <i>What should declarer do first?</i>

If South first plays on trumps, the defense might take two diamond and two heart
tricks, then play on clubs. Then, when South loses the \SK, the defense will
take two additional tricks in clubs. Spades should be played first.

With no fast entry to take the spade finesse, South just plays the \SA and
another from dummy. If East covers with the \SK, South can ruff and lose no
spade tricks! If East plays low, South can just discard a heart loser. This
type of play is called “discarding a loser on a loser” — if you lose the trick,
you've eliminated a loser anyway, so nothing is lost!

Now, when the defenders play on clubs, South can win the \CA in dummy and
discard two club losers on the established spades.

<b>Key point.</b> When playing Jacoby Transfers, a response of 2\S is used to show a
hand that wants to sign off in 3\C or 3\D. Should have a six-card suit and less
than eight points. An immediate response of 3\C or 3\D is invitational to 3NT,
an 8–9 point hand with a six-card minor.}
