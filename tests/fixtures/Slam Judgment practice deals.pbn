{<b>Bidding. </b>Holding 13 points (10 high-cad points plus three length points) East
opens 1\S. West's 3NT response in standard bidding shows 15–17 high-card
points, no five-card suit, with a doubleton in opener's suit. Opener knows
there is an eight-card fit in spades, but bids diamonds because slam is
possible.

Knowing that East holds spades and diamonds, West knows that the value of his
secondary honors in other suits is diminished greatly. The \HK and \CK J will
likely be of little value to East. West shows a doubleton spade honor by
bidding 4\S. East has bid strongly enough, and passes.

<b>Defense. </b>South leads \HQ, highest of a solid sequence. Unless the \HK is
played, North encourages with the \H9 for South to continue with the \HJ. A
trump lead also has merit, aiming to cut down on diamond ruffs in dummy.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer (East) sees that 4\S is quite high enough. There are
six sure winners. Spades can provide three or four additional winners by
finessing and length, and diamonds may provide two more length winners.

The opening lead marks North with the \HA, so declarer ducks the opening lead
in dummy and ruffs the heart continuation.

There is nothing more important to do than tackle trumps. Declarer finesses in
spades, leading a low spade from hand and playing the \SQ from dummy (unless
South plays the king). This loses to North, who will find continuing with the
\SJ the most attractive option. Declarer wins the \SA and starts on diamonds,
leaving the high trump outstanding.

The best way to tackle diamonds is to play the \DA then the \DK, which might
reveal that North started with \DJ x x x and now can be finessed. The second
round of diamonds actually reveals the bad break the other way. Is nothing
falling declarer's way? Needing one more trick, but unable to afford conceding
a diamond to get a length trick, declarer may consider finessing in clubs. <i>Is
there a better</i> <i>option?</i>

A better plan is to first lead a spade. North has to win this, and will have
the unhappy choice of leading a low heart or a club into dummy, or the \HA
which declarer can ruff, promoting the \HK in dummy. North is <i>endplayed</i>, as
long as declarer didn't squander the \HK early on.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>North holds 21 points and opens 2NT. Holding 11 points and five
spades, South responds with 3\H, a <i>Jacoby Transfer</i> to show five spades and to
get opener, the stronger hand, to bid spades since any contract usually will
play better by the stronger hand.

Opener holds excellent spade support and reevaluates as declarer, adding a
point for the doubleton heart. At maximum strength, and more, for his previous
bidding, opener can jump to 4\S, a super-acceptance of responder's transfer
bid.

As dummy, South reevaluates upward by a point for the doubleton club but no
longer counts for length. Still at 11 points, South knows that the combined
points are 32, very close to slam. However, her honors are all useful. There is
not a questionable value in South's hand. This makes South's hand worth more
than 11 points

South opts to move toward slam. She uses the 4NT <i>Blackwood</i> convention to ensure
that the partnership isn't missing two aces before bidding 6\S.

<b>Defense. </b>East has no obvious lead. A safe lead of a small spade probably is
best, keeping in mind that West will hold very little. An attacking lead of a
diamond could work out on some hands, but is risky as it is into a very strong
hand.

<b>Declarer play. </b>On a spade lead, North counts eleven sure winners. The diamond
finesse might provide a twelfth, but South's \D10 9 offer a sure way to make
the slam.

North should pull trump, play \HA-Q, \CA-K and ruff a club, and the \HK,
discarding a diamond from hand. Now, the lead of the \D 10 leaves the defenders
with no recourse. When East wins the \D J, East will either have to lead a
diamond into the A Q, or another suit for declarer to ruff in his hand for his
twelfth trick. East is <i>endplayed</i>. And, if West covers the \D10, declarer will
be able to promote a twelfth trick in diamonds.

Stripping the hand and leading the \D5 to the queen accomplishes the same
endplay. Also note that <u>South</u> cannot make 6\S if West hits upon the lead of a
diamond. Yeah, transfers!}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>After West limits the hand by rebidding 1 NT, new suits by East are
not forcing unless a reverse or jump-shift. East must jump-shift to 3\H to
compel West to bid again.

West holds four hearts, but his holding in East's suits are otherwise abysmal
while his minor-suit holdings are very strong. West should not raise hearts,
but indicate the nature of his hand by rebidding notrump. If West raises
hearts, East will try for slam quicker than you can say “Blackwood,” and the
final contract of 5 \H (missing two aces) will be in jeopardy.

<b>Defense. </b>North starts with the \C10, highest of a solid sequence. Leading
spades, East's suit, would be a poor shot.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer (West) counts six sure winners. Two more can be
promoted in spades, and another two in diamonds. Hearts will provide another if
the \H J falls.

Declarer should win the opening club lead in hand the the \CA or \CK for
maximum flexibility of using clubs as entries later. Declarer next lead a spade
to dummy's king. It is better to lead toward potential winners. When the \SK
wins, declarer leads a diamond to the king in hand, and another spade to
dummy's queen. Now with two spades in the bag, West should try dummy's hearts.
When hearts don't work, West should use clubs to enter the hand twice to get
another trick in diamonds.

West must mind entries to hand. The club opening lead removes one, but winning
the second club with the jack preserves the king to overtake the queen and
provide a third entry.

South has had to discard a heart and a diamond on tricks in spades and clubs.
After securing a second trick in diamonds, declarer actually can endplay South
in diamonds to take eleven tricks in all, losing just two diamonds.}

[Contract "5H"]
[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>South's 2\H response promises five, so North can raise with only
three. Once North raises hearts, South adds four points for shortness (but not
also two for heart length) and knows that North-South are in the slam zone.
However, South's two small diamonds are troubling, and North may hold a hand
unsuitable for slam.

South explores for slam by first bidding clubs to show the ace there. North
deprecates the \SJ and \DQ J, minor honors in side suits, and so has no reason
to go beyond game. South can make one more try for slam by bidding 4\S (5\C or
5 \H also works), which shows a control in spades and puts the focus squarely
on diamonds. However, North cannot control diamonds, and besides is now certain
that the \DQ J are worthless to South. North signs off in 5\H.

<b>Defense. </b>West leads the \DA. Leading an ace without the king is unusual against
a suit contract, but the auction has pinpointed the weakness of North-South in
diamonds. East should encourage with the \D8. After winning the \DK, East
should shift to a club up to weakness to give declarer no help.

South counts 10 sure winners. The eleventh can come from a finesse in spades or
clubs. Better is to try to establish a length trick in spades since it can be
done without risk.

South should win the \CA and start spades immediately by playing the \SA and
ruffing a spade. Then the \HA and a heart to dummy's queen to ruff a second
spade. Noting the even break in spades, South now leads a heart to the ten in
dummy, pulling the defender's last trump, to play \SK and another, discarding
two clubs on these to fulfill the contract.

Note that South needed three entries to dummy — two to ruff spades and one to
take the established spades. Declarer uses the \SA, \HQ and \H10 for the
purpose.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>East has an awkward rebid after 1\S. East holds insufficient strength
to “reverse” into 2\H, and would like a sixth diamond to rebid 2\D. 1NT, 2\C,
or 2\D are all compromise possibilities. I give the nod to 2\D because the
diamonds are strong while the clubs are weak.

West's 3\C “high reverse” should promise the values for game since it compels
South to bid at the three-level with no certainty of a fit.

After East bids 3NT, West holds quite a nice hand for suit play and makes a try
for slam by belatedly raising diamonds to show support.

East infers that West is short in hearts for having bid the other three suits.
Just as with <i>Jacoby 2NT</i> shortness bids, East's \HK Q are not valuable for slam
purposes so East signs off in notrump. 5\D will make, but notrump scores
better.

<b>Defense. </b>South leads the fourth-best heart, the unbid suit. North should play
the \H 10, third hand high, so that East does not win an undeserved trick with
the \H 9.

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer (East) counts eight sure winners and another from the
heart lead. A tenth might come from the spade finesse or club finesse, but
there is a sure way.

Declarer's strong hearts are good enough to promote a second trick there.
Declarer can win the opening heart lead and play another heart. Then, a third
round of hearts will promote a second heart trick.

Declarer will have to navigate a couple of pitfalls. If South wins a heart and
shifts to a spade, declarer should play the \S 9 from dummy, not the \SQ, to
prevent the defenders from developing two spade tricks. Also, East needs two
entries to hand: one to play a third round of hearts and one to take the
established heart. These entries must come from diamonds, so declarer must play
the \D Q from dummy and overtake in his hand (or low to the \D10) to play a
second heart. Later, declarer can take the \D J and three more diamonds to land
the contract.}

[Result ""]
{<b>Bidding. </b>When North responds 1\S, South reassesses as dummy in a spade
contract. South now holds 16 high-card points and four points for the singleton
club. Now in the zone of maximum strength for an opening hand (19–21) points,
South jumps to game in spades.

North reassesses as declarer once spades are raised, but there's no improvement
to North's 11 points. However, every card is pulling its weight — two aces are
sure values, and the \HQ will help fill out South's hearts. North drives to
slam, using 4NT Blackwood to check if two aces are missing before bidding slam.

<b>Defense. </b>East has no clear-cut lead. I would lead a club to try to create a
trick there, but it could cost a trick, too. The lead of a singleton heart in
dummy's first-bid suit leaves me cold, but could work. Leading a trump is
another good shot. Who would guess that a diamond lead makes declarer's life
difficult?

<b>Declarer play. </b>Declarer (North) counts eight sure winners and hopes for two
more from spade length. Two more can come from ruffing clubs in dummy, or
perhaps by establishing heart length. The problem with ruffing clubs is that
the second club must be ruffed with a high spade, which may be needed to pull
trumps. On the other hand, if East has led a heart, this should be read as a
singleton so that West holds five hearts and no extra trick can be developed in
hearts.

It may seem as if North can cash two high spades before ruffing clubs, but
should consider how to return to hand after ruffing the second club. Best is to
cash just one round of spades.

When the \SJ falls, declarer is nearly certain to make. Declarer can ruff both
clubs <i>high</i> in dummy, using the \CA and \DA as entries, then lead the \S7 from
dummy to high trumps and claim.

If North tries to win a second round of hearts before pulling trumps, the
contract may may fail.}
