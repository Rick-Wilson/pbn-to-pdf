{ I’ve never discussed this auction, because the 4\C bid showing 16+ HCP is exceedingly rare. It stands to reason that the only permissible bids after that are looking for slams, so they should be keycard sequences for the usual mini-Roman relay }

{ I’d expect W to raise to 3\H instead of passing, in which case I don’t think N has an asking bid available. X would be penalty, 3\S would set the suit, 3NT to play. 4-level bids sound like regular 3-suiter relays. Without interference, S would start with 3\D to show 4-1-4-4 shape. Interestingly, interference helps save space here. }
